# Robotic-Mentor
This repository will be used to build and develop an InMoov Robot. The thought here is to better understand robotics in a much finer design specification than in FIRST Robotics. I expect that my background in electronics, mechanical engineering, fabrication, 3D printer capabilities and years of computer coding (30+ years ago) and software integration and employment will be a positive thing. HOWEVER: I am not capable of completing this task by myself and wish to have others join me in this endeavour.I look forward to having assistance across the spectrum both young, old, experienced and inexperienced. We can all learn together and aswe go. Gael Langevin has been humble enough to keep all of his work, along with those he has been working with, dpensourced and able to be replicated.
I hope that you will join me starting on this project in January of 2020.
